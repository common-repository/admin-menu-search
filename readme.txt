Admin Menu Search adds a search box filter to the top of the WordPress Admin Menu so you can easily locate items on sites with lots of menus. 

== Description ==

Admin Menu Search is a simple plugin that adds a search box filter to the top of the Admin Menu in the WordPress Dashboard. No more scrolling up and down or using your browser's Ctrl+F or Find function to locate menu items.

Just enter a few characters in the Search Menus field and the Admin Menu will be trimmed down to only the items that match your search.

Submenus are also included in the search, so if you're looking for "Widgets" it will keep the "Appearance" menu in the list because Widgets lives under Appearance / Widgets.
